# Airports in the United States #
### By Brandon Larrabee ###
</b>
This map was created to show the locations of airports within the united states as part of my Webmapping Class. To accomplish this I used the instructions that were given to create the example map as well as the reading about leaflet and geoJSON. The map isn't as refined as it could be but I feel good considering this is the first class I've ever taken involving coding. I was able to include one function which was an onclick function. This function caused a popup to fire when the map is clicked and the lattitude and longitude are then given for that point. The data was provided in the lab and came from Data.gov.
